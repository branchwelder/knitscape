# knitscape

knitscape is tool for designing pattern repeats for knit slip/tuck colorwork. It
was developed with domestic knitting machines in mind, but the charts are
suitable for hand-knitting as well.

## todo

- needles in/out work
- re-add download/export
- tuck vs slip in sim
- pattern library

nice to have

- flip sim/reverse SVG layers
- sim update optimization
- adjust repeat size by dragging bounds in number gutter
- some sort of tuck/slip verification - tuck always must have knit on either
  side, slip can't be more than 4/6 rows
-

ideas

- overlay operation chart on knit sim/make it editable
- different repeat operations: mirror
- fair isle mode: specify two colors in a row, chart design switches between
  them
